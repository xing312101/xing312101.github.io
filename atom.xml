<p>I also went to Canada Place. I saw the seaplanes first time. I thought I will come here often, and it is actually happening.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2024, I was living in Burnaby. I had to commute to downtown Vancouver for school during the cherry blossom season. And I took some pictures on the way.</p>
<p>First day at school and lunch time. I bought a burrito near the Burrard Station. There was a cherry blossom tree.

<p>One day, after the rain.

<p>The cherry blossoms have almost fallen and begun to sprout. This picutre is my favorite from this cherry blossom season.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On March 23, 2024, I took the flight to go to Canada. I gave myself birthday presents: Canada ticket and working holiday.</p>
<p>In my plan, I hadda be in the air by the day, but the flight was delayed. It was not a big problem because the most important thing is I entered the day twice. Time travel!</p>
<p>So that my age is quite interesting now.</p>
<p>Before coming Canada, I decided to chooce Oliver as my English name, becuase English teachers said that some people have difficulty pronouncing Chinese names clearly.</p>
<p>I had used Kimi as my identity for 4 years. I’m not sure how long I’ll use Oliver as my identity.</p>

<p>A woman sitting next to me mentioned that it’s unusual for so many airplanes to be waiting at the moment. She is living in Canada but goes to Taiwan every two years.</p>

<p>I felt uncomfortable because I couldn't sleep well and have to sit there for long hours.</p>
<p>I sat by window side but the view was not interesting. Too brightness and blue sky only. The window had some ice crystals. I tried to take a good picture.</p>
